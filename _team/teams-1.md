Tahsina Zarin <br/>
I am a Ph.D. student at Florida International University working on extreme weather induced cross scale hydrologic connectivity of rivers and estuaries of Florida's land to ocean continuum. I will conduct numerical modeling with advanced 3D modelto simulate the hydroperiod(inundation depth and inundated areas), water level, flows and pollutant particle trajectories of the land to ocean continuum of Florida coastal zones.My research interests include Physical Oceanography, studying the coastal processes including estuarine dynamics, coastal hydrodynamics and compound flooding. <br/>
